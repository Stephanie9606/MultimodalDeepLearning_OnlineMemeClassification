# Multimodal Deep Learning

## Purpose 
Conduct a multimodal analysis (text + image) uisng NLP and Deep Learning (CNN) methods, compare the classification accuaracy between independent models and fusion models (early fusion + late fusion). 

## Data Source 
Dataset can obtained from the following [link]: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishtagatya/imgflipscraped-memes-caption-dataset?select=memes_data.tsv

## Analysis
1. Text models and image models with binary and multiclass classification
2. Early and late fusion models (text + image) with binary and multiclass classification
3. Compare each models' accuracy
